Sort 1 uses **Bubble Sort**
> Since, Sort 1 uses the lowest lower bound running time (among the three) of omega(n).

Sort 2 uses **Merge Sort**
> Since, Sort 2 uses almost the same running time for all the three conditions (random, sorted and reversed).

Sort 3 uses **Selection Sort**
> Since, Sort 3 uses the highest lower bound running time (among the three) of omega(n^2).
