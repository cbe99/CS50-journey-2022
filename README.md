# CS50 journey
Here, I have saved my solutions for the CS50 2022 edition problem sets. 

Background: 
I am a final year undergraduate student of Foof Engineering and Technology. I decided to take CS50 during my last winter vacation before becoming a full time graduate. Prior to CS50, I had theoretical knowledge of Python and have taken C programming classes during my second semester of B.Tech degree.
